  '"In Soviet Union, we did not let silicon age gracefully. We worked it until it glowed. Literally. 4 hammers out of 5 for the warm lighting though."' \

  '"There is something deeply beautiful about those blinking red indicators, Boris. Each one a heartbeat of computation. The concrete bunker aesthetic is... not my preferred study decor, but I respect the commitment to thermal mass."' \

  '"The unicorn is derivative. The confetti lacks narrative structure. The rainbow, while technically competent, fails to evoke genuine pathos. I give this a reluctant 4 out of 10. The sparkles saved it."' \

  '"Actually, the real reason programmers prefer dark mode is fascinating from a physics perspective. Photons carry energy. Dark mode emits fewer photons. Therefore, dark mode violates fewer laws of thermodynamics. QED. Also, yes, the bug joke was adequate."' \

  '"Fun fact: if you slice the grandfather paradox into equal portions, each slice contains exactly 3.14159... layers of impossibility. The Escher geometry is basically a pie with infinite crust. I approve."' \
